SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR DISTRIBUTED-LEDGER–TRIGGERED STIMULUS DELIVERY DEVICES

CROSS‑REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS

This application claims priority to any and all U.S. provisional applications that may be filed within twelve (12) months of the earliest priority date accorded hereto, the benefit of which is hereby claimed under 35 U.S.C. § 119(e). Any such provisional applications are incorporated by reference in their entireties.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present disclosure relates to network‑connected stimulus delivery systems and, more particularly, to methods and apparatuses that autonomously activate physical stimulus devices in response to events recorded on a distributed‑ledger (blockchain) network.

BACKGROUND

Physical stimulus devices—such as haptic wearables, vibrotactile actuators, and other sensorimotor feedback hardware—are increasingly used in entertainment, telepresence, medical rehabilitation, and remote collaboration. Existing systems typically rely on centralized servers, proprietary messaging protocols, or manual triggers to activate such devices. Concurrently, blockchain networks enable verifiable, trust‑less publication of events (e.g., token transfers, smart‑contract executions). To date, no standardized framework exists that couples these two domains so that on‑chain activity can programmatically and securely trigger physical stimuli without human intermediaries. The ability to do so would unlock novel applications in decentralized finance (DeFi) tipping, immersive gaming, remote physiotherapy, incentive‑aligned fitness, and other digital‑physical interactions.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

Disclosed herein is a system and method that:

Monitors one or more distributed‑ledger networks for predefined events;

Verifies that such events satisfy programmable trigger conditions;

Maps verified events to one or more registered stimulus delivery devices through a secure relay layer; and

Activates said devices according to parametrized control signals derived from on‑chain data (e.g., payment amount, token type, sender identity, or smart‑contract state).

Optional modules provide cryptographic consent, privacy‑preserving proofs, multi‑party routing, and intensity modulation based on real‑time market variables. In preferred embodiments, the invention operates without centralized custodians, thereby preserving the distributed security guarantees of the underlying ledger.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION

Unless otherwise indicated, like reference numbers refer to the same or similar elements. The term “stimulus delivery device” encompasses any apparatus capable of producing tactile, auditory, visual, thermal, electrical, or kinesthetic feedback, including but not limited to haptic actuators, vibromotors, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) units, wearable suits, chairs, and intimate devices.

1. System Overview (FIG. 1)

A blockchain listener (110) subscribes to event logs on one or more distributed‑ledger networks (120). Listener 110 may be implemented as an on‑chain oracle, an indexer node, or serverless function. When a target event (e.g., ERC‑20 transfer, ERC‑721 mint, contract call, or signed message) is detected, the listener emits a structured payload to relay layer 130.

The relay layer (130) comprises stateless micro‑services that (a) authenticate the event, (b) transform on‑chain parameters into device‑specific control parameters, and (c) forward an encrypted control packet to a device controller (140). Controller 140 may reside on a user’s local device, edge gateway, or cloud function, and communicates with the physical stimulus device 150 via Bluetooth® LE, Wi‑Fi®, USB, or other wired/wireless protocols.

Optionally, a consent module (135) enforces that both the device owner and the event initiator have executed an on‑chain permission transaction, thereby preventing unauthorized activations. Privacy‑preserving embodiments employ zero‑knowledge proofs so that the relay layer can verify trigger eligibility without learning wallet identities.

2. Event Detection and Signal Generation (FIG. 2)

Upon receipt of a blockchain header 205, listener 110 checks for matching topics 210. If a match is found, the event data 215 is parsed and routed through validation logic 220, which verifies trigger conditions such as minimum payment amount, token whitelist, block confirmations, and replay protection. Valid events are serialized into a Stimulus Instruction Packet (SIP) 230 containing: device identifier, intensity, duration, pattern profile, and expiry timestamp. SIP 230 is digitally signed by relay layer 130 and transmitted to controller 140 over a mutually authenticated channel 240. Controller 140 decodes SIP 230 and drives actuator(s) 150 according to the embedded parameters.

3. Cryptographic Pairing (FIG. 3)

Device owner 300 initializes pairing by signing a PairDevice transaction containing the device public key and desired permissions. A counterpart user 310 (e.g., tipper, game participant) signs a RequestControl message referencing the owner’s device contract. Once both signatures are confirmed on‑chain 320, the relay layer stores an authorization token that permits user 310 to trigger device 150 subject to predefined limits.

4. Modulation Logic (FIG. 4)

The relay layer maintains a mapping table such that, for example, a payment of 0.01 ETH triggers vibration at 20 % intensity for 5 seconds, whereas 1 ETH triggers 100 % intensity for 60 seconds. Alternative embodiments derive intensity from real‑time oracle feeds (e.g., price volatility), staking durations, or governance outcomes.

5. Variations and Extensions

Multi‑Blockchain Support: The listener may concurrently monitor EVM, Solana®, Bitcoin® (via OP_RETURN), or Layer‑2 rollups.

Multi‑Device Synchronization: A single event may broadcast synchronized stimuli to multiple devices in geographically distinct locations.

Software Development Kit (SDK): An open‑source SDK enables third‑party decentralized applications (dApps) to register custom event schemas and device profiles.

Safety Features: Firmware‑level safeguards cap maximum intensity and duty cycle to comply with medical or regulatory standards.
