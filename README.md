# Contract-Native-Stimulus-Protocol
 This repository contains the full open-source specification for a **decentralized, smart contract–triggered physical stimulus system** — such as haptic devices, wearable stimulators, or other actuator feedback systems. It is designed to operate **100% on-chain**, without centralized servers or off-chain trigger logic.
