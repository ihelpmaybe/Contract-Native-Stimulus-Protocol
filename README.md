# 🔓 Contract-Native Stimulus Protocol (Open Source Anti-Patent Spec)

This repository contains the full open-source specification for a **decentralized, smart contract–triggered physical stimulus system** — such as haptic devices, wearable stimulators, or other actuator feedback systems. It is designed to operate **100% on-chain**, without centralized servers or off-chain trigger logic.

📜 **Status:** Public Domain Defensive Disclosure  
📅 **Date:** 2025-06-15  
🎯 **Goal:** Ensure no individual or corporation can patent, monopolize, or gatekeep this system.

## 🧠 What This Is

- A patent-resistant open protocol for blockchain-triggered stimulation devices.
- Includes smart contract logic, consent architecture, privacy options, and extensible design for tipping, gaming, VR, therapy, or personal use.
- All physical activation decisions are driven by **on-chain events**, not centralized services.

---

## 🔧 Key Features

✅ Smart contract emits `Buzz()` events  
✅ Local listener triggers haptic or stimulus device (e.g., Buttplug.io, BLE, USB)  
✅ Optional: NFT gating, pairing consent, multisig, or zero-knowledge triggers  
✅ Anti-spam logic: burn-to-buzz, intent signatures, staking  
✅ Cross-chain compatible (EVM-based chains supported)  
✅ Full immunity from “tip-to-buzz” patent claims due to architecture and publication

---

## 💥 Variants

- **Basic Tip-to-Buzz:** ETH sent → contract emits event → device reacts.
- **NFT Access:** Only NFT holders can buzz.
- **Pair Consent:** On-chain verification of mutual agreement.
- **Proof-of-Intent:** Free buzz based on wallet-signed message.
- **Governable Buzz DAOs:** Each user can host their own trigger rules via DAO contract.
- **Private Triggers:** Anonymous zero-knowledge buzz triggers.

## ❌ Not Allowed

Anyone attempting to patent or claim exclusivity over this system forfeits all rights to use or extend the protocol per the **Anti-Gatekeeping Clause** defined in the specification.
